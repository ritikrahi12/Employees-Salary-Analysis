Employee Management Data Analysis
In this project, I designed a structured Employee Management System using SQL, Excel, and Power BI to analyze workforce trends and optimize decision-making. The key objectives of the project were:

 Data Collection & Cleaning: Imported raw employee data, handled missing values, and standardized formats for accuracy.
 Database Management (SQL): Created relational tables for employees, departments, salaries, and attendance, optimizing queries for faster insights.
 Data Analysis (Excel & SQL): Applied functions, pivot tables, and SQL queries to analyze salary trends, attrition rates, and performance metrics.
 Visualization (Power BI): Developed interactive dashboards to display key KPIs such as employee turnover, department-wise salary distribution, and attendance trends.

Impact & Insights:
 Identified high employee attrition in specific departments, enabling HR to improve retention strategies.
 Optimized workforce planning by analyzing hiring trends and salary benchmarks.
 Improved decision-making through real-time insights into employee performance and engagement.

This project demonstrates my ability to extract, clean, analyze, and visualize data, making data-driven decisions more accessible to businesses.
